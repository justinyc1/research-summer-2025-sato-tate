# This package contains code used to compute Hodge classes of Jacobians J_m of hyperelliptic curves of the form
# C_m: y^2=x^m-1, where m is any odd positive integer.
#
# The algorithms are based on [1] Shioda, T. "Algebraic Cycles on Abelian Varieties of Fermat Type" Math. Ann., 258(1):65â€“80, 1981/82. Equations 1 and 2, Theorem 5.2, and some explanations in Section 6.

# This package contains the following functions:
# For the family y^2 = x^m-1, m odd:
#    -RestrictedU
#    -Bset
#    -Exceptional
#    -Exceptionalrelprime
#
# #TODO
#    -Exceptional function for d=4 or new for loop in old one
